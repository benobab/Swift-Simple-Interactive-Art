An implementation of simple interactive art in Swift

Created a very simple interactive art work using Swift released by Apple on 2 June 2014.

Here, UIView is used to make objects for simplification and the render speed is not fast, though this means it's easy to understand the syntax. 

Note that you have to install Xcode 6 to build this project.

## The Interaction

---
Initially, 100 balls with velocity are arranged on the screen.  

You can control the objects by  

####1. Tap the screen
Change each velocity randomly and enlarge them

####2. Pan the screen
Add each velocity toward direction of your finger movement
