#Swift-Simple-Interactive-Art

![demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ytakzk/Swift-Simple-Interactive-Art/master/Demos/main.gif)

Very simple interactive art work using Swift.

Here, the circles are rendered with UIView for simplification so the rendering is not fast, which makes easy understanding of the syntax. 
## The Interaction

Initially, 100 balls with velocity are arranged on the screen.  

You can control those objects by  

####1. Tap the screen
Change each velocity at random & enlarge them

####2. Pan the screen
Add velocity toward the direction of your finger movement to them.
